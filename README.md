# Windows-11-Debloat-AI-Slop-Removal

Vibe-coded, but grounded in legit sources.
The LLM is fed verified references to reduce Windows 11 bloat and AI slop, with safeguards to detect and block any potentially malicious scripts that could be misclassified as legitimate.

## What This Project Does

This repo focuses on **performance, control, and signal over noise**:

* Removes unnecessary Windows bloatware
* Disables intrusive or useless AI features
* Frees system resources (RAM, CPU, storage)
* Improves Wi-Fi performance for gaming and streaming
* Prioritizes stability over gimmicks

## Philosophy

No placebo tweaks.
No sketchy scripts.
No “trust me bro” optimizations.

Everything is source-checked, tested, and monitored—cutting AI slop and bloat without breaking Windows.
